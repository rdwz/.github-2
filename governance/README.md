# Governance

Organization and sub-projects governance - including legal terms, licensing and trademark issues, and due process. Governance helps avoid disputes among participants down the road.

1. [organization](https://github.com/z-shell/.github/tree/main/governance/organization) directory for top-level organizational governance and policies for a technical steering committee (TSC).
2. [project](https://github.com/z-shell/.github/tree/main/governance/project) directory is for individual project governance.

## How do we use this?

1. Organization's mission is described in Section 1 of the [CHARTER.md](https://github.com/z-shell/.github/tree/main/governance/organization/CHARTER.md) file.
2. The [TSC members](https://github.com/orgs/z-shell/teams/tsc) are listed in [STEERING-COMMITTEE.md](https://github.com/z-shell/.github/tree/main/governance/organization/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md).
3. Each project under the organization's governance, has a repository where maintainers are listed in the [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/z-shell/.github/tree/main/governance/project/MAINTAINERS.md) file.
